# About me

Hi ðŸ‘‹! My name is Sjors and I'm a AI-engineer / fullstack software dev.
I like to write software that uses AI in a creative way.

I have a Master's degree in AI from the University of Utrecht.
My thesis topic was detecting the outputs of LLMs, across domains, and under adversarial attack.
The thesis can be found [here](https://studenttheses.uu.nl/handle/20.500.12932/46899).

My side projects include:
- [artexplorer.ai](https://artexplorer.ai) ðŸŽ¨, an AI supported search through all ~600.000 public art images of [Rijksmuseum](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en).
